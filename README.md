Car Sales Analysis is a project that aims to process and analyze car sales data using an ETL pipeline. The pipeline is engineered using Apache Airflow to transform raw data from PostgreSQL into clean, uniform data. The transformed data is then posted to Elasticsearch and visualized with Kibana for comprehensive statistical analysis.
